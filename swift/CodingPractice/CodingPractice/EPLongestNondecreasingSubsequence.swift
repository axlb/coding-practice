    /* This following DP approach copies subsequences (solutions of
    sub-sub-problems), when computing solution of the current sub-problem.
    This has O(2^n) space and time complexity.  That's unfortunate, since
    if we ignore this copying, our DP solution improves brute force by
    reducing time complexity from O(2^n) to O(n^2).

    An alternate approach, that would force overall complexity down to O(n^2)
    (at least until we attempt to reconstruct the longest subsequences), would
    be to store the (grid) coordinates of the next entries at any position in a
    longest subsequence.  There would be no more than 2 such coordinates at any
    position in the grid, since there are only 2 ways any subsequence can extended
    - by including or excluding the entry at the current position of the subsequence.
    If we have to retrieve all longest subsequences as a last step our time complexity
    degrades back down to O(2^n).  If we only need to return a single such longest
    subsequence, we can construct that in O(n), leaving our O(n^2) time complexity
    unaffected */
